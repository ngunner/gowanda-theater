Walk through Gowanda on a January evening and you'll probably have to plow your own way down the sidewalk. If you don't look up from the snow you might miss a rarely-lit 1950's marquee between Center and North Water street. It's a common sight in old towns. Like ancient drive-in screens -- dinosaur ruins from past civilizations -- this marquee seems abandoned and alone.

In the early 1920's a fire burnt through this block located in the northwestern portion of Gowanda's main downtown area. At the time, the family that owned the local tannery donated their own resources to rebuild the block including commisioning a famous architect from Rochester, NY to build a vaudville theater as well as connected storefronts. Jesse's Toybox, a toystore selling model trains and legos, fills one of the connected units. It's sales are mostly web driven.

The entrance to the Hollywood theater is narrow with white and gold marble walls and brass lighting fixtures. The box office stands like it hasn't aged at all. Everything is in pretty good shape less the fresh plumbing and electrical protruding certain corners. Walk through the theater doors and everything widens out. 

Detailed patterns on the ceilings and walls are overlaid with a dark layer of nicotine and tar. A velvety foyer is scattered with odd chairs and tables. When stepping into the main section of the theater it's easy to see past the the dusty and crumbling walls especially if you stand in the middle of the seatless chamber. I for one would not expect this level of grandure in this rural community. 

This theater is a metaphor for the surrounding area. It thrived through the mid 20th century and slowly dwindled as industry, namely the local tannery, left the area. And like the rest of the rustbelt, Gowanda and it's theater are being put back together.

The theater was the cultural center of the surrounding rural area but became less financialy sound through the 1980's and closed in 1992. The building remained primarily vacant untill 1998 when GARC, the Gowanda Area Regional Corporation, purchased the building from its owners and would later form an independant organization called Friends for Hollywood.

The non-profit was able to do a feasability study that led them to their marketting strategy -- this theater, if ever restored, would become a general purpose cultural center and would not limit itself to any one priority. The property would forever be at the service of the surrounding community.

Through grants and a Historic monument status, the theater in Gowanda has been slowly improving and is about to cross an important threshold.

Everyone involved in the restoration falls in love with the theater. Contractors seem to put extra care into their work once they get started and the board members volunteer many personal hours to making change.

People are the reason this project is moving. Converting doubters into believers is getting easier and with the cosmetic changes slated to happen in the coming years, gaining support for the project will be as simple as giving people tours off the street. 

Keep in mind that as a member of the Millinial generation, I like going to the movies. It's not the big screen -- it's the popcorn and sticky floors. Going to the movies is communion. Perhaps you and I would never stop each other on the street but tonight, Matt Daemen is making both our wives blush and no... nobody's sitting there. Let me move my jacket.

A resident of Gowanda told me that folks have been talking for 20 years about the theater being restored. Like Buffalo's waterfront most were pesamistic. But doubters are rarely worth focusing on because people that make change -- believe.

Mark tells me that the theater board is nearing an exciting tipping point. For years they've been laying the groundwork to make the building usable -- installing plumbing, heating, electrical and all in all getting the building up to code.
